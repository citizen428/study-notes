* 1. Welcome to AI
** Intelligent Agents
*** agent
*** environment
*** agent receives environment state through sensors
*** agent affects environment's state through actuators
*** control policy: function that maps sensors to actuators
*** perception action cycle: loop of environment feedback to sensors, agent decision, actuator interaction
** Applications of AI
*** finance
*** robotics
*** games
*** medicine (diagnostic agents)
*** on the web (crawling agents)
** Terminology
*** fully observable
**** what the agent can sense at any time is sufficient to make the optimal decisions
**** example: card game with all cards on the table
**** sensor can see complete state of environment
*** partially observable
**** needs memory on the side of the agent to make an optimal decision
**** sensor can only see part of environment, but memorizing past measurements gives additional information of the state
*** deterministic
**** agent's actions uniquely determine outcome
**** example: chess
*** stochastic
**** element of randomness involved
**** example: games with dice, like backgammon
*** discrete
**** finitely many action choices
**** finitely many things to sense
**** example: chess - finitely many board positions
*** continuous
**** space of possible actions or things to sense may be infinite
**** example: darts - infinitely many angles and accelerations
*** benign
**** random environment (stochastic), but no objective of its own
**** example: weather
*** adversarial
**** example: games - harder to find good actions because of opponent
*** Quiz: Checkers
**** fully observable
**** deterministic
**** discrete
**** adversarial
**** Poker Question
*** Quiz: Poker
**** partially observable
**** stochastic
**** discrete
**** adversarial
*** Quiz: Robot Car
**** partially observable
**** stochastic
**** continuous
**** benign
** AI and Uncertainty
*** AI is a technique for uncertainty management in computer software
*** discipline of knowing what to do when you don't know what to do
*** reasons for uncertainty
**** sensor limits
**** adversaries
**** stochastic environments
**** laziness
**** ignorance
