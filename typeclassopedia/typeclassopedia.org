This is a summary of Brent Yorgey's excellent article "The
Typeclassopedia", originally published in issue [[http://www.haskell.org/wikiupload/8/85/TMR-Issue13.pdf][#13]] of "[[http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/][The Monad Reader]]".

* Functor
** "container" with ability to apply a function to every element
   =fmap= applies function to each element of the container without
   altering the structure of the container
** a functor represents some sort of "computational context"
   =fmap= applies function without altering context
** example: a list and the =map= function
** exported by the =Prelude=
** instances
*** =[]=
*** =Maybe=
*** =Either e=
*** =IO=
*** =Tree=
*** =Map=
*** =Sequence=
*** =Stream=
*** =Set= is NOT a functor in Haskell because of the =Ord= type constraint
** laws
*** =fmap id = id=
    mapping the identity has no effect
*** =fmap (g . h) = fmap g . fmap h=
    mapping a function composition has the same effect as first mapping
    one and then the other function
** =fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b=
   =fmap :: (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)=
   the extra parenthesis show that =fmap= transforms a "normal" function
   into one operating on containers/contexts => "lift"
* Pointed
** not in the standard libraries, but in =category-extras=
** represents pointed functors
** useful for understanding =Applicative= and =Monad=
** Pointed represents additional ability for putting value in default context
** defines a =pure= function aka singleton, return, unit, point
   for example =Just= for =Maybe=
** most standard =Functor= instances could be instances of =Pointed=
** law
*** =fmap g . pure = pure . g=
*** impossible to write an instance that does not satisfy it
* Applicative
** defined in =Control.Applicative=
** newer addition to standard Haskell type classes
** applicative functors are exactly in between =Functor= and =Monad=
** every =Applicative= instance must also be a =Functor=
** adds one capability to =Pointed=, applying a function which itself is in a context
   =<*>= is basically just function application within a context
** laws
*** =fmap g x = pure g <*> x=
    =g <$> x = pure g <*> x=

    mapping a function =g= over a context =x= is the same as injecting =g=
    into the context with =pure= and then applying it to =x= with =<*>=
*** other laws relate to =pure=
** instances
*** most instances of =Functor=
*** =Const= type constructor (defined in =Applicative=)
*** =WrappedMonad= and =WrappedArrow= newtypes
* Monad
** special because Haskell made them framework for I/O operations
** special because of syntactic sugar (do-notation)
** older than =Applicative= and =Arrow=
** exported by the =Prelude=, many utility functions in =Control.Monad=
** additional instances in =Control.Monad.Instances=
** methods
*** =return= is the same as =pure=
*** =(>>)= comes with a default implementation
*** =fail= is a hack with no place in the =Monad= class
*** ~(>>=)~ aka =bind= makes =Monad= more powerful than =Applicative=
** ~(>>=)~ combines 2 computations into 1 larger computation
** structure of a monadic computation can change depending on intermediate values; more powerful than =Applicative= where structure is fixed
** instances
*** =Identity=
*** =Maybe= models computations which may fail
*** =[]= similar to =Applicative=, models non-deterministic computations
*** =IO= implemented in compiler specific ways; allows to build up values representing possibly effectful computations
*** =((->) e)= aka "reader monad" for computations with a read-only environment =e= (see =Control.Monad.Reader=)
*** =Writer= (defined in =Control.Monad.Writer=) collects information as computation progresses
*** =State= (=Control.Monad.State=) representes stateful computations
*** =Cont= (=Control.Monad.Cont=) models computations in CPS; has been called the "mother of all monads"
** utility functions
*** =join= removes one level of monadic structure
*** =liftM= is like =fmap=
*** =ap= is equivalent to =<*>=
*** =sequence= combines list of computations into one which collects a list of their results
*** =replicateM= is a combination of =replicate= and =sequence=
*** =mapM= maps first argument over second and sequences results
*** ~(=<<)~ is ~(>>=)~ with reversed arguments
*** ~(>=>)~ is like function composition but with an extra =m= on the result type of the functions and swapped arguments
*** many of the above function have underscore variants (like =mapM_= that are only used for side-effects and throw away the results of the computations)
** laws
*** ~return a >>= k = k a~ (injecting and binding is the same as applying)
*** ~m >>= return = m~ (binding and returning leaves =m= unchanged)
*** ~m >>= (\x -> kx >>= h) = (m >>= k) >>= h~ (~(>>=)~ is sort of associative)
*** ~fmap f xs = xs >>= return . f = liftM f xs~ (ensures that =fmap= and =liftM= are the same for types which are instances of =Functor= and =Monad=)
** alternative laws using =(>=>)=
*** =return >=> g = g= (=return= is the identity of =(>=>)=)
*** =g >=> return = g= (same as above)
*** =(g >=> h) >=> k = g >=> (h >=> k)= (=(>=>)= is associative)
** do-notation
*** syntatactic sugar for "imperative style" programming
*** do-blocks are recursively translated into monad operations
*** plays strongly on "computational context" interpretation rather than "container" interpretation
** monad transformers
*** used for combining monads into a new monad
*** =State=, =ReaderT=, =ErrorT= and (soon) =MaybeT=
*** build composite monads "inside out" (see lambdabot's =@unmtl= command)
*** all monad transformers implement the =MonadTrans= typeclass (=Control.Monad.Trans=)
** =MonadFix=
*** describes monads which support the fixpoint operation =mfix=
*** =mfix :: (a -> m a) -> m a=: allows output of monadic computation to be defined via recursion
*** =mdo= is a "recursive do" notation
* Monoid
** a set =S= with an associative binary operation =⊕= and an identity element in respect to that operation
** examples:
*** natural numbers under addition
*** integers under multiplication
*** boolean values under conjuction and disjunction
** defines several functions
*** =mempty= is the identity element
*** =mappend= is the binary operation
*** =mconcat='s default implementations folds =mappend=, usually sufficient
** laws
*** =mempty `mappend` x = x=
*** =x `mappend` mempty = x=
*** =(x `mappend` y) `mappend` z = x `mappend` (y `mappend` z)=
** instances
*** defined in =Data.Monoid=
*** =[a]=, with =mempty = []= and =mappend = (++)=
*** =Sum= and =Product= newtype wrappers for numeric types under addition/multiplication
*** =Any= and =All= as newtype wrappers for =Bool= under disjunction and conjunction
*** =Maybe=, as well as =First= and =Last=
*** =Endo a=, newtype wrapper fo =a -> a=, which form a monoid under composition
*** =Ordering = LT | EQ | GT= with =mempty = EQ= and =mconcat (zipWith compare xs ys)=
*** instances for container types
** other monoidial classes
*** =Alternative= for =Applicative= functors with monoid structure
*** =MonadPlus= for monads with a monoid structure (monads which support "choice and failure")
*** =ArrowZero= and =ArrowPlus= for representing =Arrows= with monoid structure
* Foldable
** defined in =Data.Foldable=
** for containers that can be "folded" into a summary value
** container-agnostic
** to make an instance either implement =foldMap= or =foldr=
*** =foldMap :: Monoid m => (a -> m) -> t a -> m=
*** =foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b=
** instances
*** =List=
*** =Maybe=
*** =Array=
*** containers like =Map=, =Set=, =Tree=
** module contains generalized versions of =Prelude= functions like =concat=, =any=, =all= etc.
** generic functions to work with =Applicative= or =Monad= instances like =traverse_=, =sequenceA_= etc.
** =Foldable= operations forget structure of container type, but =Traversable= will preserve it
* Traversable
** defined in =Data.Traversable=
** every =Traversable= is a foldable functor
** instances only need to implement =traverse= and =sequenceA=
** =sequenceA= is the key method of =Traversable=
*** =sequenceA :: Applicative f => t (f a) -> f (t a)=
*** answers the question when we can commute two functors
*** ability to compose two mondas depends crucially on this
** instances
*** =[]=
*** =Maybe=
*** =Map=
*** =Tree=
*** =Sequence=
*** =Set= is not =Traversable= even though it's =Foldable=
** =Traversable= and =Functor= instances are almost identical, but =Traversable= takes place within an =Applicative= context
** any =Traversable= functor is also =Foldable= and a =Functor=, both classes can be implemented only with methods from =Traversable=
* Category
** fairly new addition to Haskell standard library
** generalizes notion of function compositions to general "morphisms"
** defined in =Control.Category=
** instance of =Category= should be something of kind =* -> * -> *= (a type constructor which takes 2 type arguments)
** instances
*** =(->)=
*** =Kleisli=
** methods
*** =id :: cat a a=
*** =(.) :: cat b c -> cat a b -> cat a c=
** law
*** =id= and =(.)= should form a monoid (=id= should be identity of =(.)= and =(.)= should be associative)
** two additional operators
*** =(<<<)=, a synonym for =(.)=
*** =(>>>)=, is =(.)= with its arguments reversed
** can only represent categories whose objects are objects of =Hask=, more general category treatment in =category-extras=
* Arrow
** another abstraction of computation, like =Monad= and =Applicative=
** type of an =Arrow= computation reflects both its input and output
** =Arrows= generalize functions, may represent some sort of "effectful" computation
** =Category= class constraint, so we get identity arrows and arrow composition for free
** methods that need to be implement
*** =arr :: (b -> c) -> (b ~> c)=: takes any function =b -> c= and turns it into a generalized arrow =b ~> c=. Says we can treat any function as an arrow.
*** =first :: (b ~> c) -> ((b, d) ~> (c, d))=: turns any arrow from =b= to =c= into an arrow from =(b,d)= to =(c,d)=. Processes first element of a tuple while leaving the second one unchanged
** further methods
*** =second :: (b ~> c) -> ((d, b) ~> (d, c))=: similar to =first=, but with elements of tuple swapped
*** =(***) :: (b ~> c) -> (b’ ~> c’) -> ((b, b’) ~> (c, c’))=: "parallel composition" of arrows; takes two arrows and turns them into one on tuples (first arrow on first element, second arrow on second element)
*** =(&&&) :: (b ~> c) -> (b ~> c’) -> (b ~> (c, c’))=: "fanout composition"; takes two arrows and makes them into a new arrow which supplies its input to both arrows, returning their results as a tuple
** instances
*** only two instances in library
*** =(->)=, the normal function constructor
*** =Kleisli m= which makes functions of type =a -> m b= into =Arrows= for any =Monad m=
** laws
*** =arr id = id=
*** =arr (h . g) = arr g >>> arr h=
*** =first (arr g) = arr (g *** id)=
*** =first (g >>> h) = first g >>> first h=
*** =first g >>> arr (id ***h ) = arr (id *** h) >>> first g=
*** =first g >>> arr fst = arr fst >>> g=
*** =first (first g) >>> arr assoc = arr assoc >>> first g=
*** =assoc ((x,y),z) = (x,(y,z))=
* ArrowChoice
** allows for alternate execution paths based on intermediate results
** methods
*** =left :: (b ~> c) -> (Either b d ~> Either c d)=
*** =right :: (b ~> c) -> (Either d b ~> Either d c)=
*** =(+++) :: (b ~> c) -> (b’ ~> c’) -> (Either b b’ ~> Either c c')=
*** =(|||) :: (b ~> d) -> (c ~> d) -> (Either b c ~> d)=
*** similar to =first=, =second=, =(***)= and =(&&&)=, but operating on sum types instead of product types (tuples)
*** operate on arrows whose inputs are tagged with =Left= and =Right= and choose how to act based on that
*** =left g= has the behavior of =g= for inputs tagged with =Left= and behaves as the identity for inputs tagged as =Right=
*** =right g= is the mirror image of =left=
*** =(***)= performs "multiplexing": =g= behaves as =g= for inputs tagged as =Left= and =h= behaves as =h= for inputs tagged as =Right=; tags are preserved
*** =(|||)= is "merge" or "fanin": like =(***)= but tags are discarded; mnemonic: =g ||| h= performs either =g= *or* =h=.
* ArrowApply
** more flexible than =ArrowChoice=
** can *compute* an arrow from intermediate results and this computed arrow continues the computation
** method
*** =app :: (b ~> c, b) ~> c=
*** allows us to apply a computed arrow to an input
*** this is exactly what monadic bin (~(>>=)~) does
*** =ArrowApply= and =Monad= are equivalent in expressive power
*** any instance of =ArrowApply= can be made a =Monad= via =ArrowMonad=
* ArrowLoop
** describes arrows that can use recursion to compute results
** used to desugar =rec= construct in arrow notation
** GHC has a special arrow notation similar to do-notation that allows to assign names to intermediate results
* Comonad
** categorical dual of =Monad=
** =extract= is the dual of =return=
** =duplicate= is the dual of =join= (adds layer of monadic wrapping)
** =extend= is the dual of ~(>>=)~ with arguments in different order
** can be defined by =fmap=, =extract= and *either* =duplicate= or =extend=
